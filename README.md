Counting Networks
=================

Counting networks are a special type of balancer networks which count.

They were first introduced by Aspnes, Herlihy, and Shavit in the 
following paper:

  James Aspnes, Maurice Herlihy, and Nir Shavit. 1994. Counting networks. J. ACM 41, 5 (September 1994), 1020-1048. 

This project's goal is to evalute the scalability of counting networks in
modern SMPs.
